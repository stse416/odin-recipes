TOP Recipes Project

This project as organized seems as if it will have me utilize all the various lessons in the previous chapters to setup a basic recipe website. Possibly TOP will have me come back to "pretty it up" with CSS after covering the topic.

Topics it'll likely address:
1. Setting up the HTML page with standard boilerplate.
2. Utilizing various tags such as <h1>/<h2>, <p>, <em>, <ul>, <li>, etc.
3. Linking to other sections / pages on the website.
4. Using images.
