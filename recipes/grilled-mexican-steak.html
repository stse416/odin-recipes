    <p class="recipe_description">Mouth-watering marinated steak with a touch of spice</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup cumin seeds</li>
        <li>5 jalapeno peppers, seeds and ribs removed, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1½ cups olive oil</li>
        <li>2 bunches cilantro (leaves and stems incl.)</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) skirt or flank steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the cumin seeds in a medium saute pan over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, or until fragrant. </li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, pepper, lime juice, and salt. Pulse the blender to finely chop ingredients. Add the oil and cilantro and puree until smooth. </li>
        <li>Lightly score both sides of the meat with a knife so that the marinade will penetrate. Place the meat in a large plastic bag or bowl, pour in the marinade, and coat well. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. </li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and discard the remaining marinade. Cook on high, 1 to 2 minutes per side, to sear the meat. Turn the heat down to low and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until the it has reached the desired doneness. </li>
    </ol>
